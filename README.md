# About This Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end sentiment analysis pipeline using **Flask**, **Azure Language Service**, **Cosmos DB**, and **Power BI**.

The **Flask** web app accepts text input from users and sends it to the **Azure Language Service** for **sentiment analysis** and **key phrase extraction**. The analyzed results — including sentiment scores and key phrases — are stored in **Azure Cosmos DB** as structured JSON documents.

Using **Power BI** with **DirectQuery**, the stored data is visualized in real time, allowing users to explore sentiment trends and insights dynamically.

## 🔍 Key Features
- **Flask Web Interface:** Simple and lightweight dashboard for user input.  
- **Azure Language Service Integration:** Performs sentiment analysis and extracts key phrases.  
- **Cosmos DB Storage:** Saves analysis results in a scalable NoSQL database.  
- **Power BI Visualization:** Displays real-time analytics directly from Cosmos DB.  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)  
- **Cloud Services:** Azure Language Service, Cosmos DB  
- **Visualization:** Power BI (DirectQuery)  
- **Environment:** Linux Workstation  

## 🎯 Purpose
This project demonstrates how cloud-based AI and data services can be integrated into a lightweight web application to turn raw text into actionable insights — from user input to real-time visualization.
